# Handwritten Digit Classification using CNN

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used is the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to create an accurate model that can recognize and classify these digits.

## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a well-known problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The MNIST dataset serves as a standard benchmark for testing image classification algorithms. This project aims to leverage the power of CNNs, which are highly effective for image data, to classify these handwritten digits with high accuracy.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```
## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is included in Keras and can be easily loaded using the following command:

```python
from keras.datasets import mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.




Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using Keras' Sequential API. The architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers. The model structure is as follows:

Input Layer: Accepts images of size 28x28 pixels with a single channel (grayscale).
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images using filters.
Max Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, retaining important features while decreasing computational load.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D feature vector for the dense layers.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that output the predicted probabilities for each class.

## Training the Model
The model is trained using the training dataset. We compile the model using the categorical crossentropy loss function and the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. The model is then fit on the training data.

## Visualizing Predictions
After training, we visualize the model's predictions on a subset of the test dataset. The original images are displayed alongside their predicted labels to assess the model's performance qualitatively.


## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits using a CNN. The model can achieve high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in image recognition tasks. Future work may involve experimenting with different architectures, optimizers, and regularization techniques to further improve accuracy.
