Convolutional Neural Network Image Classification
This project demonstrates the design, training, and testing of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The model is built to classify images into six categories and was developed as part of the Digital Image Processing course in the 7th semester of the Department of Electronics.

Project Overview
The CNN model is trained on a dataset provided by Intel and solves the problem of classifying images into the following categories:

Building
Street
Forest
Glacier
Mountain
Sea
The model is designed to take any input image and predict its category from the above list. It uses a dataset of over 14,000 images for training, 7,000 images for validation, and 3,000 images for testing.

Features
Input: An image provided to the model.
Output: The model classifies the image into one of the six categories.
Is the image of a Forest?
Is it a Mountain?
Is it a Street?
Is it a Glacier?
Is it a Sea?
Or is it a Building?
The project includes various steps like data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation, all implemented in Python on the Kaggle platform.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains:

Training images: 14,000+
Validation images: 7,000+
Testing images: 3,000+
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and contains images from the six classes mentioned earlier. The dataset is split into training, testing, and validation sets to ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.

Model Details
The CNN model uses several convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling layers to extract relevant features from the images and classify them into the correct categories. Further details on the model architecture, the kernels used, and feature extraction methods are provided in the project notebook.

Implementation
Programming Language: Python
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Platform: Kaggle (using CPU and GPU for high-efficiency computations)
Kaggle is used due to its availability of powerful GPU and CPU resources, which are essential for training large CNN models efficiently.
